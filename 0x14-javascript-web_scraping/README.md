General
	* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
	* How to manipulate JSON data
	* How to use request and fetch API
	* How to read and write a file using fs module
	* Copyright - Plagiarism
	* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
	* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
	* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
	* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
General
	* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
	* All your files should end with a new line
	* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
	* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	* Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB styl
	* All your files must be executable

More Info
Install Node 14
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Install semi-standard
Documentation
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```
Install request module and use it
Documentation

```
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, it's a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
